  <h2>Web Development</h2>

  <p>In today's digital world, your website is often the first impression people have of your business, service, or brand. I'm here to make sure it's a good one. I specialize in crafting clean, modern, and mobile-friendly websites that don't just look great—but work great too.</p>

  <p>As the founder of <strong>HTML by Design</strong>, I approach every project with a hands-on mindset. Whether you're looking to build your first website, give an old one a new lease on life, or need someone to handle the technical side of getting your site online—I've got your back.</p>

  <h3>What I Do:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Custom Website Design:</strong> Hand-coded websites using HTML and CSS, tailored to your style, brand, and needs. No cookie-cutter templates—just bespoke design.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive Layouts:</strong> Your website will look sharp and function smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobiles. A seamless experience no matter what screen your users are on.</li>
    <li><strong>Fast Loading Speeds:</strong> Optimized code and clean structure mean your site loads fast. No waiting around, no bloated pages—just smooth performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Simple Navigation:</strong> I build sites that are easy to use and intuitive to navigate. Visitors will find what they’re looking for without frustration or confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Search Engine Ready:</strong> My builds are structured for SEO, giving your site the best chance to be seen on Google and other search engines.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility Focus:</strong> Websites that everyone can use, including users with disabilities or slower internet connections.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Process:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> We’ll talk about what you need, who your site is for, and what goals you have in mind.</li>
    <li><strong>Design Mockup:</strong> I can provide a visual layout of the site (using Canva or Figma) so you can approve the look before I touch code.</li>
    <li><strong>Build:</strong> This is where the magic happens. I bring the design to life using clean, organized code that’s easy to manage and maintain.</li>
    <li><strong>Launch & Support:</strong> Once your site is ready, I’ll help with hosting setup, domain linking, and any ongoing support you might need after launch.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Who This Is For:</h3>
  <p>Whether you're a small business owner, a startup founder, a local tradesman, a content creator, or just someone with an idea—you don’t need to speak "tech" to work with me. I keep things straightforward, transparent, and tailored to your level of comfort with the web.</p>

  <h3>Why Work With Me?</h3>
  <p>I’m not a massive agency juggling dozens of clients. When you work with me, you get one-on-one communication, consistent updates, and a site that’s built with pride—not rushed through a production line. My background in tech support means I know how to solve problems, not just design around them. And as someone actively learning and improving every day, I bring hustle, honesty, and care to every line of code I write.</p>

  <p>If you’re after a reliable, no-nonsense web developer who listens, explains things clearly, and delivers quality—then I’d love to chat.</p>

  <p><strong>Let's build something awesome together.</strong></p>
