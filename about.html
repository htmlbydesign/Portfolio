  <section class="about-me">
    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mark — a hands-on, self-taught web developer and tech support specialist based in the UK. I didn’t come up through a fancy degree or Silicon Valley startup. I came up the hard way — learning on the job, staying up late breaking things, fixing them again, and figuring it all out piece by piece. I’m a believer in real experience, self-education, and putting your skills to the test in the real world.</p>

    <p>I started HTML by Design to bring no-nonsense, honest tech services to people who just want stuff to work. Whether it’s a slick new website or helping someone fix their Wi-Fi, I approach every job with the same focus: do it right, explain it clearly, and leave the client better off than when I arrived.</p>

    <p>Before I stepped into web dev and tech, I worked with my hands in tough jobs. I know what it’s like to graft hard and get little in return. That’s why I put so much pride into what I do now — because I’m not just building websites or fixing PCs, I’m building a better life for myself and a better experience for my clients.</p>

    <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Helping people:</strong> Whether it’s a business owner or a mate struggling with a laptop, I love being the guy who gets things working again.</li>
      <li><strong>Creative problem-solving:</strong> No two jobs are the same. I like working out clever, practical solutions to weird tech problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Learning every day:</strong> Tech never stops changing, and I never stop learning. It keeps things exciting and sharp.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Get With Me</h3>
    <p>You’re not hiring a faceless company. You’re working with someone who listens, explains things clearly, and treats your project like it matters — because it does. I’m reliable, flexible, and I won’t blind you with buzzwords or try to sell you stuff you don’t need.</p>

    <p><strong>If you want real service from someone who gives a damn, you’ve found the right guy.</strong></p>
