    <h2>Software & Hardware Upgrade Service</h2>
    <p>Still rocking a slow PC or stuck with outdated programs? Don’t worry—I upgrade both software and hardware to bring your system into the present. Whether you're using your computer for work, gaming, school, or everyday browsing, I’ll help boost its performance and extend its life.</p>

    <h3>Software Upgrades</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Operating System Upgrades:</strong> Move from Windows 7/8 to 10 or 11 smoothly, with backups and settings preserved.</li>
      <li><strong>Driver & BIOS Updates:</strong> Ensure your hardware is supported and runs at optimal performance.</li>
      <li><strong>App Installations:</strong> Install, configure, and troubleshoot office software, browsers, creative tools, and more.</li>
      <li><strong>System Cleanups:</strong> Remove bloatware, outdated programs, and free up space the right way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hardware Upgrades</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SSD Upgrades:</strong> Replace your old hard drive with a solid-state drive for major speed boosts.</li>
      <li><strong>RAM Upgrades:</strong> Identify your system’s limits and install compatible memory for better multitasking.</li>
      <li><strong>Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Cards:</strong> Upgrade internal adapters to support the latest standards and faster speeds.</li>
      <li><strong>Cooling Improvements:</strong> Install additional fans or thermal paste to reduce overheating.</li>
      <li><strong>Peripheral Setup:</strong> Configure new monitors, printers, webcams, or speakers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Upgrade Instead of Replace?</h3>
    <p>Upgrading is often cheaper than buying a new system—and better for the environment too. If your PC still has life left in it, I’ll help you get the most out of it with affordable, smart upgrades that actually make a difference.</p>

    <h3>How I Work</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Initial Assessment:</strong> I’ll take a look at your current setup and needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Upgrade Plan:</strong> I’ll recommend the best-value upgrades tailored to your budget.</li>
      <li><strong>Install & Configure:</strong> I’ll install everything and test it to make sure it's running like a dream.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Whether it’s speeding up an old laptop or supercharging your home setup—I’ve got you covered.</strong></p>
