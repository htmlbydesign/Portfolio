    <h2>Website Hosting & Setup</h2>
    <p>Getting a website live can feel like a minefield — domain names, DNS records, web hosting, FTP... it’s enough to make anyone's head spin. That’s where I come in. I take the hassle out of the hosting process so you can focus on what matters: your content, your customers, and your business.</p>
    <p>Whether you're starting from scratch or need help moving your existing site to a new host, I provide clear, step-by-step support. I handle the tech bits and walk you through everything in plain English.</p>

    <h3>Why It Matters:</h3>
    <p>A website isn’t useful if no one can see it. Hosting and setup is where the magic happens behind the scenes. With my help, your website will be live, secure, and built on a strong foundation.</p>

    <h2>Website Upgrade Service</h2>
    <p>Already got a website but it feels outdated, clunky, or just plain broken? I offer upgrade services to bring your existing site up to modern standards. Whether it’s a design refresh, improved functionality, or a full rework — I’ll help you make your website better, faster, and easier to use.</p>
    <p>Think of it like a tune-up for your digital presence. I’ll take what you’ve got, identify what's working (and what’s not), and then enhance it so your visitors get the best possible experience.</p>
    <h3>What I Can Fix or Improve:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Outdated Designs:</strong> Give your site a fresh, modern look without starting from scratch.</li>
      <li><strong>Broken Links & Navigation:</strong> Repair dead links and make your menus easier to use.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile Responsiveness:</strong> Ensure your site looks good and works well on phones and tablets.</li>
      <li><strong>Speed Optimization:</strong> Clean up unnecessary code and make your site load faster.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Why Upgrade?</h3>
    <p>People judge your brand based on your website. If it feels neglected, visitors bounce. An upgraded site keeps them engaged and boosts trust. You don’t always need a new website — sometimes a solid upgrade is all it takes.</p>
    <p><strong>Let’s breathe new life into your existing site.</strong></p>
