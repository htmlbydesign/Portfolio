    <h2>Welcome to HTML by Design</h2>
    <p>Where old-school grit meets modern tech. I'm Mark, a self-taught web developer and tech support wizard with a toolbox full of skills and a passion for helping people bring their ideas to life online. This isn't some cookie-cutter agency run by a team of suits — this is one guy, one screen, and a whole lot of drive. If you're after clean code, clever fixes, and a straight-talking approach to websites and tech, you’ve just landed in the right place.</p>

    <p>I help small businesses, content creators, hobbyists, and everyday folks build their digital presence with confidence. Whether it’s a sleek new website, hosting help, a performance boost, or tech support when your PC’s acting up — I get stuck in and get the job done. No fluff. No overpriced nonsense. Just good, honest service that works.</p>

    <p><strong>HTML by Design</strong> was born from a simple idea: make the digital world less confusing and more accessible for people who just want things to work. I speak your language, keep it real, and tailor everything I do to fit your goals, not my ego.</p>

    <p>From hand-built websites to remote support sessions where I walk you through every step — I bring the patience of a teacher, the problem-solving of a techie, and the quality of someone who actually gives a damn. Your success online is my success too.</p>

    <p>So whether you’re starting fresh, fixing what’s broken, or levelling up your setup — let’s make it happen. Explore my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>, check out my <a href="services.html">services</a>, or <a href="contact.html">drop me a message</a> and let’s talk about what you need.</p>

    <p><strong>This is web development done right. No gimmicks. Just results.</strong></p>
